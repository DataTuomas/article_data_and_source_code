# Supplementary Data and Figures

This repository contains the data, source code and figures used in figures of an article. 

* Data files are located in the 'data'-directory  
* The pdf-figures are in 'exported_images'  
* Interactive .html versions are found in 'interactive-htmls'  
* Jupyter notebook containing the source code for creating the figures is found in 'source'  

The source code has some repetition that could be refactored away, but as the goal of this project was to create figures, 
the editing of code will not be of urgent need.

This project depends on Pandas, NumPy and Plotly (with Orca for .pdf exports) to work.
